## CSS SELECTORS

CSS selectors are patterns used to select HTML elements based on their attributes, types, and relationships with other elements. They allow you to apply styles and perform manipulations on specific elements or groups of elements on a web page.

Here are some commonly used CSS selectors:

1. Element selector: Selects elements based on their HTML tag name. For example, `p` selects all `<p>` elements.

2. Class selector: Selects elements with a specific class attribute. It is denoted by a period (`.`) followed by the class name. For example, `.my-class` selects all elements with the class "my-class".

3. ID selector: Selects a single element with a specific ID attribute. It is denoted by a hash (`#`) followed by the ID name. For example, `#my-id` selects the element with the ID "my-id".

4. Attribute selector: Selects elements based on their attribute values. It is denoted by square brackets (`[]`). For example, `[type="text"]` selects all elements with the attribute `type` set to "text".

5. Descendant selector: Selects elements that are descendants of another element. It is denoted by a space between two selectors. For example, `div p` selects all `<p>` elements that are descendants of a `<div>`.

6. Child selector: Selects elements that are direct children of another element. It is denoted by a greater than sign (`>`). For example, `ul > li` selects all `<li>` elements that are direct children of a `<ul>`.

7. Adjacent sibling selector: Selects the sibling element that immediately follows another element. It is denoted by a plus sign (`+`). For example, `h1 + p` selects the `<p>` element that directly follows an `<h1>`.

8. General sibling selector: Selects sibling elements that follow another element. It is denoted by a tilde sign (`~`). For example, `h1 ~ p` selects all `<p>` elements that follow an `<h1>`.

These are just a few examples of CSS selectors. CSS provides a wide range of selectors to target specific elements or groups of elements, allowing you to apply styles and manipulate the appearance and behavior of your web page.
